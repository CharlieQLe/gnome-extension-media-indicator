# MPRIS INDICATOR

## What is this?

A simple indicator that pops up to the left of the clock if a MPRIS-supported media player is running.

## What versions of GNOME does MPRIS INDICATOR support?

At the moment, it has only been tested with GNOME 43, but should support earlier versions as well. Submit a PR for the versions that work.

## How do I install this?

Tar packages nor an extension page are not available yet.

The source can be used by cloning this repository and running the install script like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlieQLe/gnome-extension-mpris-indicator.git
sh install.sh
```

After the installation, simply log out and log back in and it should show up in the Extensions application!
